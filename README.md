## Development

The project is based on [Nx](https://nx.dev).
You must have Node.js installed as well as the Nx CLI:

```bash
npm install -g nx
```

You can then start the testbed project that provides simple usage of the connection library.
You must also build the library so that the application can use it:

```bash
nx build mixer-connection

nx serve testbed
# OR
npm run testbed
```
